<p>Dear ______,

This message is for your eyes only. 

You have been cordially invited to attend People Whoâ€™s first ever extravaganza. This is a secret cocktail event hosted by Max Miller and Fran Romano who have hand picked you and four other guests for a night of excitement. There is a specific commonality between you and the other guests which will be revealed at the end of the night. Your job as a group will be to decipher this common thread while enjoying cocktails in the likeness of our home.

As to avoid distress, you are allowed to bring a friend along for the ride. 

The event will take place on Thursday, January 20th, 2022 at precisely 9:02 PM. Arrive at the foyer of 1026 W Trinity Avenue in formal attire and do not be late. Await further instruction once you arrive.

Please RSVP by Saturday, January 15th, 2022 with your name and your guest name to a group chat with:

Max Miller:  &

Remember, secrecy is of utmost importance. 

Cheers,
pw</p>

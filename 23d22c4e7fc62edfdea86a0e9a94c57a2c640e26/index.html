You have been cordially invited to attend People Who’s latest extravaganza. This is a secret cocktail event hosted by Max Miller and Fran Romano who have hand picked you and four other guests for a night of excitement. There is a specific commonality between you and the other guests which will be revealed at the end of the night. Your job as a group will be to decipher this common thread while enjoying cocktails in the likeness of our home.
<br>
  <br>
As to avoid distress, you are allowed to bring a friend along for the ride. 
<br>
  <br>
The event will take place on Thursday, February 10th, 2022 at precisely 9:32 PM. Arrive at the foyer of 1026 W Trinity Avenue in formal attire and do not be late. Await further instruction once you arrive.

Please RSVP by venmoing @Francisco-Romano 15$ (includes you and your guest) by Wednesday, February 9th, 2022 with your name and your guest name in a PRIVATE venmo transaction.

<br>
You have been cordially invited to attend People Whoâ€™s biggest extravaganza yet. This is a secret cocktail event hosted by Max Miller and Fran Romano who have hand picked you and eleven other guests for a night of excitement. While we typically have a specific commonality between you and the other guests, this week will be different... 
  <br>
 <br>
Due to the bigger invite list this week, you will not be able to bring a plus one.
<br>
  <br>
The event will take place on Saturday, April 23rd, 2022 at precisely 6:02 PM. Arrive at the foyer of 1026 W Trinity Avenue in cocktail attire and do not be late. Await further instruction once you arrive.
<br>
  <br>
Please RSVP by Friday, April 22nd in a group chat with Max (803-543-7514) and Fran (919-951-5588).
  <br>
   <br>
Remember, secrecy is of utmost importance. 
<br>
 <br>
Cheers,
<br>

 P.S. We kindly suggest a donation of 10$ [@francisco-romano] for you and your guest so that we don't go broke. xoxo
